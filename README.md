# EDdy
Just a very extremely simplistic cli editor


It was meant to be as simplistic as possible.
I just wrote it because "EDIT" appeared removed from Win10 leaving me without a quick editor to use from the CLI when I am in my office.

It's a bit inspired by EDLIN. People who used the earlier DOS versions must be familiar with it, although EDdy is not quite the same.
