# EDdy
Just a very extremely simplistic cli editor


It was meant to be as simplistic as possible.
I just wrote it because "EDIT" appeared removed from Win10 leaving me without a quick editor to use from the CLI when I am in my office.

It's a bit inspired by EDLIN. People who used the earlier DOS versions must be familiar with it, although EDdy is not quite the same.

People are free to use it under the terms of the GNU GPL 3 license
